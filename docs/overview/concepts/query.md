# Query and Stream Processing

## What is a Query?

A **Query**, in short, is a **Stream Processing** task.

Stream Processing is done by **Queries**. A running query will manipulate/filter stream and return continuous results in real-time. With queries, real-time monitoring and response can be easily implemented.

## Stream Processing

Stream Processing in our context is that we can choose to do a series of operations to the HStream streams. In HStreamDB, steam processing supports [TODO].
